## bureaucratic stuff (noiaaaa)
Even if i don't like doing it, here we are:\
Here there is the [license](https://github.com/Dicast3/Veluntra/blob/main/LICENSE)\
Here there is my [disclaimer](https://github.com/Dicast3/Veluntra/blob/main/Disclaimer-eng.md)

If you don't feel like reading, I'll summarize everything in a few words:
1. I'm not responsible for what you do or what happens with this tool (that's your business, don't contact me if your computer has eaten your cat now).
2. This project is for educational purposes; if it's not used for that purpose, I'll be very angry.
